Precision Math

Introduction

This project first started when I learned that in JavaScript couldn't correctly 
solve 0.1 + 0.2. It'd produce 0.30000000001, owing to computer's limitation as 
a binary calculator, not decimal. 

Since discovering the problem, other difficulties, such as inability represented
repeating decimals, and not having handy math library made me want to build a 
JavaScript math library that enhances the accuracy of calculation by sacrificing
speed.

Most of the functions are used once to produce somme sort of math problem, so 
speed isn't an issue.
