		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Since becoming a private math tutor, I've been able to get a lot of insights as to why
			a lot of students struggled with math. There are many smaller reasons, but they large fall into
			two categories: being unable to actually understand the material, and lack of guided practice. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When students first learn math in elementary school, they start with arithmetic. It is largely intuitive,
			and for those who don't really "get it," a teacher can bring some sense to them by demonstrating visually. 
			If a student doesn't really understand why 47 + 29 equals 76, the teacher can perhaps lay out 4 dimes and 
			7 pennies for the first number, 2 dimes and 9 pennies for the second one, and show that their combination
			results in 6 dimes and 16 pennies, which is 76 cents. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This visual approach, however, quickly becomes difficult as the numbers get bigger, or as students start to learn
			fractions and decimal. A teacher can only come up with so many 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ... , 1/24 pieces of shapes 
			to teach their students how to add and subtract fractions. As a result, teachers end up teaching a set of rules and steps
			to take in order to arrive at an answer, rather than teaching to arrive at a conclusion by taking a set of logical next steps. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Consequently, for those who don't "get" math, math becomes a set of arbitrary rules and instructions that have no bearing
			in real life. To them, math (and later on, science) is nothing more than a hoax, sort of like alchemy and astrology.
		</p>
		<p>
			To remedy the problem, I have been making a set of apps that can visually and logically demonstrate why the math principles they
			illustrate are true. Then I've began to organize those apps onto a platform (still a work in progress) in order to systematically
			record and observe students performance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another big problem that hinders the effort of the students is the lack of motivation. To compare, almost everyone knows
			the benefit of eating vegetable and exercising, whether they like it or not; almost everyone knows the benefit of practicing
			drawing, as it could lead to stunning drawing later. Most students, however, don't see any benefit of doing math. For the vast
			majority, especially those who are struggling, the biggest question in math is "why are we evening learning this?" The simple truth
			is that the vast majority of them will not end up using math in their future careers. That's why I've implemented a reward system
			that motivates students (especially younger ones) to earn coins in order to watch videos. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The following is a list of what I have so far. The list is updated periodically to reflect my most recent progress. 
			Because I have to do everything from the front-end to back-end, things are a little rough.

                As described in the application, this is app is still in development,
                and has barely enough functionality to show the proof of concept. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The demo showcases all the exercises that have been integrated onto
                the platform at the moment. The exercises listed below will be integrated
                into the platform as necssary. However, currently all efforts are put in improving
                the platform itself rather than adding more exercises. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, the student must do the exercises/homework listed under "To Practice: " 
                on top. As you can see when you hover over the angle-bracket (">"), students
                must meet certain requirements in order for them to be considered "complete."
                A teacher can set various requirements, among them are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting a certain number of questions correct</li>
                    <li>Doing a certain number of questions</li>
                    <li>Getting a certain number of questions conrrect consecutively</li>
                    <li>Achieving a certain average time for the exercise</li>
                </ul>

        <div id="alg-bas-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                Traditionally, algebra has bene taught on paper, and paper only,
                without a lot of handson approach. As a result, starting from algebra,
                kids start to develop the notion that that math is a set of arbitrary
                rules and abstract concepts at best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some books attempt to illustrate why algebraic rules are the way they
                are by providing some illustrated examples, but without

        <a target="_new" href="../../app/areaOfTri">Area of Triangle From Coordinates</a>
        <div id="areaOfTri-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                This exercise trains students to find the area of a triangle formed from
                three random points on a coordinate plane.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there's a forumla produces the area, without the knowledge of the
                formula, student must exhibit a range of abilities in order to solve the problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First, perhaps most obviously, the student must know what a coordinate plane is
                and how the coordinate system works. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, the student must be able find distance between two points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the student must know how to find an equation between two points on a coordinate plane
                and then be able to find a point on the line with a given x or y value.

            <p>
                Built as a tool to help kids visually understand numbers beyond 100 and subsequently adding them, 
                this exercise lets the user to practice recognizing the number of blocks by counting the set of 
                blocks in different units that are represented in different colors.

        <div id="div-intuit2-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                Traditionally, when a student learns division, he is told to follow a certain set of steps
                in order to arrive at the answer. Students are almost never taught why those steps work
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is designed to let students do divisions by hand in order to develop a sense of
                how it all works.

        <div id="div-intuit3-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                The premise behind the development is same as Division Intuition 2, but for divisors that 
                are greater than 10. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also unlikely Division intuition 2, it employs a story problem to logically derive the
                solution.

        <a target="_new" href="../../app/factors">Finding Factors</a>
        <div id="factors-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                A large chunk of elementary school math can become absolutely trivial if the
                student knows how to find all the factors of a number, and know how to work 
                with them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This exercise trains students to find the number of factors, then all the factors
                of a given number.

        <div id="num-pat-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                In this exercise, the given set of numbers have a constant difference.
                The student's job is to recognie the pattern and find the next number.

    <div class="item">
        <a target="_new" href="../../app/permutation">Permutation and Combination</a>
        <div id="num-pat-desc" class="item-desc">
            <p>
                This app lets students try out what all the permutation and combination 
                of a certain set looks like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because finding the permutation requires factorial operation, the number of elements
                that can be permutated is limited to 7.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should you decide to permutate a set of 7 characters, 
                you might have to wait for a bit until the operation finishes.

                This exercise lets the student practice finding the parabola that fits through
                a set of three random points on a cartesian coordinate plane. It requires the 
                knowledge of parabola, and matrix operation called row reduction.
