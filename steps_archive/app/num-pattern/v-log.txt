v1		: 	All the components components work and keeps log of statistic
v2		: 	added timing feature and it works.
v3		:	objectified components and some UX/UI improvement:
			-check for right, x for wrong
			-quit button works
v4		:	UX/UI improvement:
			-pressing start counts down
			-made the operators and operand float
			-arranged placements and general cosmetics
			-count down
			-measures time
			-check/x mark when right/wrong
			
			
-create user object that keeps track of
	-min. time
	-min. accuracy
	-min. speed

gotta collect time.. 
create options menu on pause
try it in other browsers
make stat object sole dealer of timer
put how to level up:
-create points threashold for each level
-pt = speed * accuracy * level;
-incorrect = level * -2
speed = question/time






============
Notes
------------
The goal of this app is to help kids train their calculating speed
For me, it's a chance to make a simple app that is vertically integrated; 
it enables log in and tailored page view.



============
Milestones
------------
-make basic feature: adding, right/wrong, basic stat
-login and stuff

-make more secure
-timer/healthbar/score to push sense of urgency

============
Notes
------------
*Gotta make it unhackable by using functions and closures?
