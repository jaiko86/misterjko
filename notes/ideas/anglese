The idea is to translate the entire legal writings into something robot can understand legalese. 

The name is a portmanteau of anglicize and legalese. The idea is to make the legalese understandable to robots, so robots can answer questions about legality that people query. 

Answer a bunch of question, like the one I did for CS course, and get relevant legal info and maybe the lawyer can contact them or something if they think they have a case
