A lot of behavioral questions

----
strength / weaknesses
- For weakness, find a professional weakness, not personal weakness
- Weakness: 
  - I hadn't had chance to work in a group at a company, so I perceive 
    this to be my potential weakness.
  - Sometimes I lose focus of the task, I go down the rabit hole. 
    - I assess semi daily whether what I did was productive, and if not,
      what is preventing me from moving forward with the project
  

Why Amazon? What do I think of Amazon?
- I want to learn and grow
- Amazon is a machine. It's a part of the movement that incrementally, but surely disrupts
  every market it sets its foot in. I want to be part of that movement. 
- I want to especially learn machine learning and machine vision. 
  - The first time I was really impressed was with the Amazon's scanning feature
    that identified a product.
- When we were planning for our wedding, the planner showed us a lot of photos
  of dresses, different venues, flowers, etc. I thought it was ripe for disruption
  with modern technology. When I started thinking about how such venture would work
  it got me thinking about dresses. I worked at Banana Republic before, and there 
  were a lot of fits and style, and body shapes, etc that one has to consider 
  when making women's clothes. It got me thinking about how the future technology
  would make this work. 
  
  When I think of these kind of problems, I try to think of it from the future's perspective
  If I were in the future, where things like these services are common, what feature would 
  I be mad about not being included? 

Why hire me? (how would I fit well into Amazon?)
- When I was reading the 14 leadership principles of Amazon, I was surpsied to see
  how many of them I actually used in running my tutoring business. 

Questions for THEM:
- Do you guys allow certain time off from the main work so the engineers can work
on improving their skills and talent?
- Although I am pretty familiar with Java, since it was my college's language of choice,
  I am mostly skilled in JavaScript. Do you think this will be a problem?
-What would be my role in this team?
