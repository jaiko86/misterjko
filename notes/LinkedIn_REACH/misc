removed ideas / components


- Experience in Korea
  - AJ's headhunting agency is not doing well in this environment
  - Jisue's headhunting agency isn't doing so bad. 
  
  - I can tell how completely different set of ideals and culture (Korea vs US)
  work out, and pros and cons of each, and why the pros and cons of each country 
  will never happen in the other country; why LinkedIn will never successfully
  can land in Korea;
  
  
  - Steps Education: The problem with education is a mesh of individual thread of problems
    - Knowledge transfer: people aren't computers, and data can't just transfer between
      people. Teachers can only plant kernels of ideas into the minds, and the kids have
      to grow the seed themselves. 
    - Performance tracking: 
    
    - Because of the inefficiency, kids have to be taught in bulk, called "classes"
    - Because classes aren't tailored, tests have to be conducted. Tests aren't conducted
      as a way of gauging student's performance. It is conducted as a way of saying, 
      "you better study hard, because how much work you put in or don't put in this thing
      will immortalized as a permanenent record." It's not like tests are conducted, then
      failing students are given extra help to help them understand before moving on to
      the next topic. 
  - I was working full-time, but teaching only part time. 
  - Being busy and productive are two different things

-I went back and forth between Korea and the US a lot
-Because of it, I developed not just linguistic depth, but also deep cultural understanding of both countries. 
-My last stay in Korea was right after college, where I originally moved for personal reason, but ended up staying. 
-While my life there as an elementary school student built my language skill, my most recent stay there, as someone who has new perspective on society, business, and government, gave me fresh perspective and analytical skills to parse and comprehend what I was experiencing there. Despite ranking high in economic charts, and despite being considered a “developed nation” by many standards, why I left Korea; I have formed opinion and perspective on everything from the government, society, and businesses run, and how technology develop. 
-Because of my background, I was able to contrast the best and worst part of each country, and decipher how each country can benefit by emulating each other. But also why it would never happen or happen very slowly. 
--Such thing as public transportation, and bureaucracy 
---American workers in lower income level will never ever be as good as those in Korea. Job is too valuable in Korea, and in America, those talented enough to do work efficiently don’t work in low-paying jobs.  
-I would know why LinkedIn would never succeed in Korea, and probably in China as well.  
-Having been a private tutor there, I understand why and how the education affects the society, and why Korea can never become as powerful as the US.  
I was good at both Western and Chinese chess. I loved writing, debates, folding origami, and math.

College
Initially I was attracted to physics (one of my favorite subjects from high school), but I eventually chose math as my focus. There was something more fundamental about math than physics.

While studying math, I took all the computer science for non-major students. This includes basic programming course in which we learned Java, Object Oriented Programming paradigm, basic data structures and algorithm. At a more advanced level, we learned algorithm run times, and more sophisticated algorithms.

It around my later years in college that I started to teach math as a side job to supplement my income.

I was an officer for Korean Student Association for four years, in which I spent two years as webmaster.

Move To Korea
Due to personal reason I quit school to move to Korea.

I started teaching as a private tutor while looking for a more permanent position, but found that there was a lot of market potential as a tutor, and became a full time tutor.

Steps Education
After teaching math for a while, it became obvious to me that a lot of what I did could be automated: generating problems, grading them, analyzing them, and telling parents about their students' performance.

I used my programming skills to make independent apps and tools that met its objectives.

When my apps started accumulate, I realize the need to centralize and integrate the apps. Hence Steps Education was born.

Back To The States
While in Korea, I met my wife, and had my son. I realized I didn't want to raise my son in Korea, so I quit everything and moved back to the states.

I'm currently in search of a new opportunity in which I can be an asset to a company that presents unique and exciting challenges.

Way back when, before the days of Facebook or even MySpace, there was a social networking site called Asian Avenue. 
Then Xanga
Then high school, but the guy wasn’t very good at teaching. Then I was just left on my own until college. Saw my friends doing homework for computer science course
In college, I saw some of my friends doing homework for introductory computer science courses. They said it was really hard. As someone who’s intrigued by, rather than aversive to puzzle challenges, I took it the next quarter. The course was taught in Java, with focus on object oriented programming. We learned about class, inheritance, et cetera. It went from there to algorithm design. 
I eventually moved to Korea, where the second part of my learning began. As I was trying to build a platform for my teaching, I learned a lot. 
I learned why frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue came along, and why state is important. 
The third phase of my programming journey started when I came back to the States. As I am preparing to get a job as a programmer, I am building websites, catching up on the latest standard and tools, and learning Vue.

 Steps Math: Although only partially finished, with a lot of holes, this is something I built from ground up that started me off on a path as a programmer. I believe I learned more about programming from this single initial project than from all of my college CS courses combined. It’s not because of the depth or the focus of topic. On the contrary, it had no focus, and it was built in pieces as I waded into the programming field. Whereas a college course might have a homework with specific requirements and due date, my project didn’t have a due date; I had to come up with the project requirements as I was building it, I had to design it, program it, host it on the server, test it out in different browsers, etc. A college course, at least initially, give the students tools (IDE, configurations, frameworks, libraries, etc.) to get them started as soon as possible. Not just in of the programming aspect of the work either. I had to first identify the problem, and design a solution for it. I learned modularity. I designed a custom library to power it. I learned MVC principle;

My best work, Steps Education, does not use the latest framework, best programming practice, or has the best design. In fact, it probably has a ton of holes that even novice hackers can exploit. Yet it is dear to my heart and something I show off as my best work because it represents a full-stack of work, not just in a programming sense, but in a business sense. Underlying what seems like a simple website is years of teaching experience, know-how, lessons learned from talking with parents, and some programming.
To build Steps Education: I had to advertise, provide customer service, design, program, test, host, and finally teach with what I built. The work was not hard because it was a lot, but because I had to do so many different parts of a business myself. While building my platform, I learned modular design, MVC principle, and got to experience why some of the programming adages exist, such as not future-proofing from the beginning.  
That’s why I am still working on it in between looking for jobs. I am updating it with the latest framework, updating designs, patching bugs and holes, and refactoring. I am working on it because I want to launch a startup, should my search for employment fail. The market has spoken that my business idea is good. Why am I so confident? In a country where an average office worker, working more than full time made around $2,000 a month, I was able to make triple that without a college degree. That’s why I am confident. 
I am not confident because of my programming skill. In fact, I have a lot to learn. However, I am confident because of my business acumen, insight, and ability to business need to software objective.

Tidbits:
-Seoul is more populous than the ten least populous states combined. 

-They may have wrapped up their thing nicely, but ultimately, this is like a 
job hunt. I should think about what they would want to hear, and why they want to 
hear it that way. 


In an education system design to cull the meek rather than nurture the growing, I was able to find the parents wiling to take my approach to teaching. I was about to convince them of something highly unusual from their perspective. 

I am good at explaining complex topics simply


- That I realized Korea's politics-ridden work culture is not the symptom of 
  its culture, but of its hyper-competitive environment
  
  
- Teaching is a leadership position, just like KSA
