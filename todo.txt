make things with vue:
-refactor/combine the scroll-dependent animations
-Make the headers switch as page scrolls
-main nav
-carousel
-timeline
-section nav for portfolio
    -Make the section nav button clickable area bigger


Make KenKen smaller GUI (for smaller screen)
-> Maybe make a table instead?
-> Make non-gui that shows all the solution sets that it iterates over?


menu toggle:
-triple bar <--> close <--> "<" (go back)

****

when the last or first slide is on, the left and right margin are not even.
