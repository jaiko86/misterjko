I can't figure out:

-Given string s and string t find whether all permutation of t is present as substring in s.

-Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s 
forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
Input : 
matrix = [   
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], 
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]
Output : 5
(I think this uses graph)

1. Magic of 3

A number ending with 3 will have a multiple which is all 1. e.g. multiple of 3 is 111 and of

13 is 111111. Given a number ending with 3 find its least multiple which is all 1. The

2 multiple of the given number can be beyond the range of int,long etc. Optimize for time.

--> 
multiplier = 7
while(answer not found)
  product = n * multiplier
  if( product consists of all 1s, then return)
  else multiplier += 10

2. Most Frequent

Given an integer array, find the most frequent number and it's count in the array. Write the

code in O(1) space. Eg 1 , 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 2 Output Most frequent number is 2. The

frequency is 3. Return the output as string in 'number: frequency' format. e.g. 2: 3 (Please

note the space after : and frequency. If multiple numbers have the same highest frequency

return the smallest number.

--> sort and count

-------
3. Maximize

A swap operation M on an array is defined where you can only swap the

adjacent elements. Given an array containing digits and n swap

operations(defined as below), maximize the value of the array.

Example: Array 1, 2, 4, 3 (value = 1243), Number of swaps 2

Output 4,1,2,3 (value = 4123).

>>>
while(swap > arr.length)
  - starting from arr[0], swap with the highest number available.

from g4g: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/closest-palindrome/0
Given a number N. our task is to find the closest Palindrome number whose absolute difference with given number is minimum.

Input:
The first line of the input contains integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains a  number N.

Output:
For each test case, the print the closest palindrome number.
Note:  If the difference of two closest palindromes numbers is equal then we print smaller number as output.

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=n<=10^14

Input :
2
9
489

output:
9
484
