## Experience

### STEPS EDUCATION, SEOUL, KOREA 
_FOUNDER / FULL STACK DEVELOPER / TUTOR June 2015 – December 2017_

Created from ground up an education platform that aided teaching math to students 
in Korea. Greatly reduced lesson prep time from >15hours/week to < 30 min/week and 
significantly improved revenue and profit. As part of the role, I have developed : 
* PRECISION.JS LIBRARY     Designed to overcome the shortcomings of native JavaScript math by storing numbers in arrays, and operating arithmetic with/on them, in order to preserve precision. Backbone of the platform’s math operations.

	* Perform frequently used math functions, such as greatest common factors, prime factorization, etc.
	* Parse and solve arithmetic operations of repeating decimal numbers and fractions.
	* Calculate factorial, combination, and permutation with precision far beyond practical needs.
	* Understands and operates with repeating decimals (e.g. 0.23 ̅-1/3= -0.1).    

* INTERACTIVE APPS    Visually and interactively presented various math concepts, such as fraction and time arithmetic, solving single variable equations, and decimal numbers. Improved student engagement, interest, and understanding of the topics. 

* PROBLEM GENERATOR / PERFORMANCE TRACKER    Generated practically an infinite number of problems for various math topics. Problem difficulty adjustable at granular levels to aid students' mastery of topic.
	* Used PrecisionJS to ensure randomly generated fractions, decimals, and big integers calculated to the correct answer. 
	* Used PHP and MySQL via AJAX (XHR) calls to check users’ input, record performance, and to tabulate, graph, track, and analyze students’ performance over time for specific topics.
* SMS TEXT NOTIFICATION    Used third party API (NEXMO) and PHP to automatically send text messages (SMS) to parents about missing assignments or change in performance. Greatly improved clients’ confidence.
* BRAND    Distinguished myself among target market as a private tutor who used technology to teach. Hourly wage increased 140% (~$45 → ~$63) and revenue increased over 250% (~$2.4k → ~$6k) compared to before using the platform.

## Portfolio 
Additional selection of work hosted on my GitHub and website 
* **KenKen Solver** 	App that solves KenKen, a puzzle akin to sudoku, but with arithmetic.
* **Algebra Basics**	App that lets users solve single-variable algebra problems by dragging/dropping tiled numbers and variables.
* **Knight’s Tour**		App that solves and visualizes the Knight’s Tour problem on an 8 x 8 board from any given position.

## Miscellaneous 

* **University of Washington, Seattle**    Mathematics B.S. 2005.06 – 2011.09 (discontinued)
* **Private Math Tutor**    Taught math as part and full-time job since 2009. Excellent in explaining and simplifying complex topics
* **Webmaster, Korean Student Association**     Updated, maintained, and modernized the club website during college (volunteer)
